/**
 * Holds every accessible foreground token in `_variables.scss` to the rule its
 * own comment states: "the lightest value of the same hue and saturation that
 * clears 4.5:1 against white, $color-bg-muted and its own 10%/12% tint".
 *
 * That rule was checked by hand when the tokens were introduced in F9.7, and
 * `$color-info-blue-text`, added afterwards for a different job (white text on
 * a blue fill), was never measured against its own tint. It sat at 4.49:1
 * there. Nothing could see it: the history view's "Editada" badge is the one
 * place blue text sits on that tint, and until the seed wrote an audit trail
 * there was no row to render the badge in, so the axe audit passed an empty
 * table. The first run with real rows failed on it.
 *
 * Each `$color-<name>-text` token is paired with `$color-<name>`, its fill.
 * A new text token without a fill of the same name fails here on purpose, so
 * it has to arrive with the pair it is meant to be read against.
 *
 * F9.8 added the two surfaces this file itself was missing: the tint on
 * `$color-bg-muted`, not only on white. Every token cleared the white cases
 * and failed the muted ones, which is how the calendar's badges reached CI at
 * 4.16:1 — measured there for the first time once the view stopped clipping
 * the panel they render in.
