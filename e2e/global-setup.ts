/**
 * Runs once before the whole Playwright run (all projects/workers), not once
 * per worker — the login endpoint's 5-requests-per-minute throttle
 * (requirements.md §1.1) can't absorb every project independently re-logging
 * in for the same credentials. Pre-warms fetchAccessToken's on-disk cache
 * (e2e/.auth/, gitignored) for every credential pair loginViaCookie is known
 * to use, so no spec ever needs its own real /auth/login round trip for
 * session-seeding — only loginViaUI's form-driven tests (auth.spec.ts) still
 * hit the endpoint for real, by design.
