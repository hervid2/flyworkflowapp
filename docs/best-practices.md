## Next.js / React

- **Server vs. Client Components by default**: every component is a Server Component unless it needs browser state, effects or events (`'use client'` explicit and as low in the tree as possible, never in `layout.tsx` if avoidable).
- **Semantic naming**: hooks start with `use` and describe the data they return, not the implementation (`useDashboardMetrics`, not `useMemoizedFilteredArray`). Components in `PascalCase` describing what they render, not where they live (`CriticalIssuesList`, not `DashboardTable3`).
- **One component, one responsibility**: if a component mixes fetching, metrics calculation and presentation, extract the calculation into a pure selector in `domain/selectors/` (the pattern already used in `dashboard-metrics.selector.ts`) and the fetching into a hook.
- **Derived state, not duplicated**: if a value can be computed from other state (`useMemo`), it isn't stored separately in the store — avoids drift.
- **Server Actions or Route Handlers** only if Next.js edge logic is genuinely needed; all real business logic lives in `backend/` (NestJS), not the frontend.
- **Absolute imports** with the already-configured `@/*` alias; never `../../../..`.
- **SCSS Modules with BEM** (an already established pattern): `.component__element--modifier`, one stylesheet per component, no global selectors outside `styles/base/`.

## Responsive / Adaptive Design

See `requirements.md §1.12` for the formal requirement — this section is the implementation "how".

- **The four `_variables.scss` breakpoints are the single source of truth** (`$breakpoint-mobile: 480px`, `$breakpoint-tablet: 768px`, `$breakpoint-desktop: 1280px`, `$breakpoint-wide: 1600px`) — no new component introduces a media query value different from those four.
- **Data tables follow the pattern already used in `CriticalIssuesList`**: `.tableWrapper { overflow-x: auto; }` as the acceptable floor on mobile, first evaluating whether a transformation into stacked cards or breakpoint-prioritized columns makes sense before accepting horizontal scroll as the final solution.
- **`min-width: 0` on flex/grid children that could overflow**: the same fix already applied reactively in `DashboardView` to stop Recharts from forcing horizontal overflow — apply it upfront in new layouts with charts or tables, not as a later patch.
- **Minimum 44×44px touch targets** on any clickable element visible on a mobile viewport (see also `§Accessibility`).
- **Modals with a max height and internal content scroll**, never the full document, so they fit small viewports without clipping edges or corners.

## i18n (next-intl)

- **Namespaces by domain/feature** (`dashboard`, `map`, `issues`, `auth`, …), never a single flat dictionary — avoids key collisions and makes it obvious where each text lives.
- **Server Components read messages with `next-intl`'s server utilities** (`getTranslations`); **Client Components use `useTranslations()`** — the two styles are never mixed within the same component.
- **No hardcoded literals** once the language switcher is real (`requirements.md §1.9`): every visible text —including Zod validation messages and the domain's status/priority labels— goes through a translation key.
- **Pluralization and date/number formatting via ICU message format** (native to `next-intl`), never manual string concatenation.
- **`es` as the explicit fallback locale**: a key missing in `en` should never be visible in production as a raw, untranslated key.

## Motion / Animations (React)

Library: **`motion`** (motion.dev, successor to Framer Motion). Adds motion on top of the already-existing interface — layout and palette aren't redesigned, see `requirements.md §1.11`.

- **`useReducedMotion()` first, always**: any animated component checks the hook before defining its variants; if the user has "reduce motion" enabled at the system level, the animation is replaced with a ~100ms cross-fade or skipped outright. This isn't optional (a Must requirement).
- **Reuse the transition tokens already defined** in `_variables.scss` (`$transition-fast: 0.15s`, `$transition-normal: 0.25s`) as the basis for Motion's durations, instead of inventing new values — keeps a single source of truth for "how fast the interface moves".
- **Where it fits**: staggered entry of cards/lists on mount (`staggerChildren`), `whileHover`/`whileTap` on clickable elements (1.02–1.03 scale, never more — an exaggerated hover feels like a bug), modal enter/exit transitions with `AnimatePresence`.
- **Where it doesn't**: don't animate Recharts' own chart rendering (it already has native animation — animating it twice looks choppy); don't animate on every re-render, only on real state transitions (mount, period change, open/close); never animate content critical to completing a task (a form shouldn't "dance" while the user types).
- **Isolate in Client Components**: like any interactivity, animation lives in components already identified as `'use client'` — it doesn't suddenly turn a Server Component into a client one just to decorate its container.

## TypeScript

- **`strict: true` with no exceptions** — don't add `// @ts-ignore` without a comment explaining why it's unavoidable.
- **Domain types as the source of truth**: any type representing a business entity (`Incident`, `Organization`, etc.) lives in `domain/models/` (frontend) or the Prisma schema (backend) — never hand-duplicated inside a component.
- **`type` vs `interface`**: `interface` for object shapes that can be extended (entities, props), `type` for unions, intersections and function aliases.
- **No implicit `any`**: if the true type is unknown at write time (an external response, `unknown`), use `unknown` and narrow with a type guard, never `any` as a shortcut.
- **Pure functions where possible**: if a function doesn't depend on I/O or external state, it should be testable without mocks — an existing example: `getDashboardMetrics`.
- **Identifiers always in English**: function, variable, type, file and git branch names in English, both frontend and backend — Spanish is reserved exclusively for visible UI copy (and its English counterpart via i18n, `requirements.md §1.9`). This also applies to commit messages (already English in the project) and to Prisma schema column/table names.

## Code Documentation

Code is documented minimally but professionally — it's not "no comments" flatly, it's documenting the _public surface_ and staying quiet about internal implementation when it's already readable on its own.

- **Exported functions/hooks/services carry TSDoc** (`/** ... */` with a one-line description, `@param`, `@returns` when not obvious from the type) — applies to anything another file imports: `domain/` selectors, `services/` services, `hooks/` hooks, and their equivalents in `backend/src/modules/*/**.service.ts`.
- **Internal/private code follows the project's general rule**: no comments unless they explain a non-obvious why (an external constraint, a specific workaround) — documenting _what_ a line does when the function name already says so is noise, not documentation.
- **HTTP API documented with `@nestjs/swagger`**: every controller and DTO carries the decorators (`@ApiTags`, `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@ApiProperty`) needed for `/api/docs` to generate a browsable OpenAPI spec — it's the standard professional pattern for a NestJS REST API, and it also serves as living documentation for anyone reviewing the portfolio project without reading the code.
- **README per package**: `backend/README.md` documents how to run the backend locally, the same way the root `README.md` already documents the frontend.

## NestJS (backend)

- **One module = one responsibility**: `AuthModule`, `IncidentsModule`, `OrganizationsModule`, etc. — each with its own `*.module.ts`, `*.controller.ts`, `*.service.ts` and `dto/`. Never a monolithic `AppService`.
- **Real dependency injection**: services receive their dependencies through the constructor (`PrismaService`, other services), never instantiated with `new` inside another class — this is what makes the backend testable with real NestJS mocks (`@nestjs/testing`).
- **DTOs validated with `class-validator`** on every API input — never trust that the frontend already validated (Zod on the client is UX, not security).
- **Guards for authorization, not loose `if`s in the controller**: `JwtAuthGuard`, `RolesGuard`, `OrgScopeGuard` applied with decorators (`@UseGuards`, `@Roles(...)`) — the "who can do what" logic lives in one reusable place.
- **SOLID principles applied concretely**:
  - _S_ (single responsibility): a service shouldn't validate business rules, talk to Prisma, and build the HTTP response all at once — split into a service + output mapper/DTO if it grows.
  - _O_ (open/closed): new notification or export types get added by implementing a shared interface, not by modifying a giant existing `switch`.
  - _L_ (Liskov substitution): if a `StorageProvider` interface is defined (for S3), any alternative implementation must be able to replace it without breaking whoever consumes it.
  - _I_ (interface segregation): input DTOs specific to each use case (`CreateIncidentDto` ≠ `UpdateIncidentDto`), not a single giant DTO with every field optional.
  - _D_ (dependency inversion): domain modules depend on abstractions (`PrismaService`, storage interfaces), never import an AWS SDK client directly inside a business service — that lives in `lib/s3/`.
- **`main.ts` (local dev) separate from `lambda.ts` (Lambda handler)**: both share `AppModule`, but the dev bootstrap shouldn't be coupled to the serverless adapter.

## Prisma / SQL

- **Migrations always generated, never hand-edited** (`prisma migrate dev` locally, `prisma migrate deploy` in CI/production).
- **Explicit indexes** on every column used in high-traffic `WHERE`/`ORDER BY` clauses (`orgId`, `status`, `createdAt` on `Incident`).
- **Avoid N+1**: use Prisma's `include`/`select` to fetch relations in a single query instead of iterating and querying per row.
- **Low `connection_limit`** in the connection string (1–3) given Lambda's concurrency pattern against Railway's free plan.
- **Versioned seeds** (`prisma/seed.ts`) — never populate test data by hand in production or directly on Railway via console.

## Docker

- **Multi-stage build required**: an install/build stage with `devDependencies`, a minimal final stage with only what's needed to run (official Lambda Node.js base image) — reduces size and attack surface.
- **Complete `.dockerignore`**: `node_modules`, `.git`, test files, local `dist` — should never end up copied into the final image.
- **One image, two test contexts**: built once and validated both with the Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator locally and, later, on the actual deployed Lambda — never "works on my machine" without going through that emulator first.

## AWS SAM / CI-CD

- **`template.yaml` is the source of truth for infrastructure** — no resource is created by hand through the console except what the AWS guide explicitly marks as a one-time account step (IAM user, billing alarm).
- **Never secrets in the repo**: Railway connection string, JWT secret, AWS credentials — always as SAM `NoEcho` parameters or GitHub Secrets, never in `template.yaml` or a versioned `samconfig.toml`.
- **CI runs on every PR, deploy only on `main`**: a strict separation between "verify it builds and tests pass" (every PR) and "publish" (only after merging to `main`).
- **Each pipeline is scoped to its folder** (`paths: backend/**` vs. everything else) so the frontend CI doesn't re-run when only the backend changes, and vice versa.
- **Log retention explicitly configured** in CloudWatch (14 days) — a log group with no retention accumulates cost indefinitely even though ingestion's free tier is perpetual.

## SEO

- **Next.js Metadata API** (`generateMetadata`) instead of manual `<head>`.
- **`robots.txt` + explicit `noindex` on authenticated routes**: the application is private behind login, so SEO only matters for `/login` and an eventual public landing page — indexing a user's dashboard would be a privacy mistake, not just an SEO one.
- **`sitemap.xml`** generated only for real public routes.
- **Core Web Vitals**: keep `next/image` for every remote image, code-splitting already in place (Mapbox, Recharts lazily loaded) as the standard for any new heavy library.

## Testing

- **Every code change ships its test in the same iteration** — never "we'll test it later" as a separate phase.
- **Vitest on the frontend, Jest on the backend** — each stack uses its idiomatic tool; don't force a single testing tool across the whole monorepo for superficial consistency.
- **Domain tests (selectors, services) are pure functions with no mocks** whenever possible; mocks are reserved for real boundaries (HTTP, database, S3).
- **E2E against a real backend** in CI (ephemeral Postgres as a job service), never just against mocks once the backend exists — an E2E suite that never touches the real API doesn't catch broken contracts.

## Accessibility

- Maintain and extend the level already reached in the current frontend (ARIA roles, `aria-live` on notifications, full keyboard navigation, visible focus) to every new roadmap page (History, Gallery, Documents, Calendar, Settings).
- Every interactive icon with no visible text carries an `aria-label` — the new FlyWorkFlow logo/mark is no exception when used as a button (e.g. "go to home").
- Minimum AA contrast on the gold/dark palette already in use, explicitly verified when introducing any new color (notification severity, approval states).
- Minimum 44×44px touch targets on mobile (`§Responsive / Adaptive Design`, `requirements.md §1.12`) — an interactive icon that looks fine on desktop shouldn't shrink its real hit area when scaled down to small viewports.

## Security (basic OWASP checklist for the API)

- Input validation at the edge (`class-validator` + global `ValidationPipe`).
- Always parameterized queries via Prisma — never raw interpolated SQL.
- Global rate limiting across the whole API (`@nestjs/throttler` as an application-level `ThrottlerGuard`), with an additional, stricter limit on `/auth/login` — protects both against credential brute-forcing and against scraping/abuse that could exhaust the free quota of Lambda invocations or Postgres connections on Railway.
- Security headers (`helmet`) and CORS with an explicit origin (never `*`) once the frontend consumes the real API.
- Passwords with bcrypt, never in plaintext or with a reversible hash.
- Refresh token in an `httpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=None` cookie (cross-domain Vercel↔API Gateway).
- `npm audit` (or equivalent) as part of the CI pipeline, both in `frontend` and `backend`.
- Rotatable secrets, never committed — if one leaks by mistake, it gets rotated, never "well, it's already committed so never mind".
